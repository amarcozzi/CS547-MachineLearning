    "# Problem 1: Legal Reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose a crime has been committed and blood is found at the scene. This blood type is present in 1% of the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above scenario can be modeled with Baye's Thereom as \n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(C|B) = \\frac{P(B|C)P(C)}{P(B)}$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "where random variable $C$ represents whether an individual commited the crime, and random variable $B$ is whether or not an individual has this rare blood type.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 1\n",
    "\n",
    "The prosecution claims that \"there is a 1% chance that the defendant would have the crime blood type if he were innocent. Thus, there is a 99% chance that he is guilty.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The prosecutor computed the likelihood term in Baye's theorem. Given that the accused is innocent, then there is a 1% chance of observing the crime blood type. $P(B=\\textrm{rare type} | C = \\textrm{innocent}) = 0.01$. Thus, taking $1 - 0.01 = 0.99$ the prosecutor concludes that the accused is likely guilty. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the prosecutor has committed an error by going from the probability of observing a blood type given innocence, to the probability probability of being guilty given a blood type. If we establish that $P(B=\\textrm{rare type} | C = \\textrm{innocent}) = 0.01$, then we cannot say that $P(C = \\textrm{guilty} | B= \\textrm{rare type)} = 1 - 0.01$. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is apparent when we consider Baye's thereom as written above because $P(C = \\textrm{guilty} | B= \\textrm{rare type}) \\propto \\textrm{likelihood} \\times \\textrm{prior}$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 2\n",
    "\n",
    "The defendant claims that because the crime occured in a city of 800,000 people, then the blood type would be found in approximately 8,000 people. Thus, there is a $1/8000$ chance that the accused is guilty.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case the defendant computed $P(C=\\textrm{guilty}|B=\\textrm{rare type}) = P(B=\\textrm{rare type}) = 1/8000$. We immediately see that this a violation of Baye's theorem because the defendant has ignored the likelihood and prior terms, and has only computed the normalization term in the denominator. "
